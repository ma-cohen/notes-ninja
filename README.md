# Notes Ninja

A personal assistant for Cursor that manages your notes and todos using slash commands.

## Installation

Run the install script with your preferred folder name:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ma-cohen/notes-ninja/main/install.sh | bash -s my-notes
cd my-notes
cursor .
```

To sync your notes with GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (any name you like)
2. Connect and push:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo-name.git
   git add . && git commit -m "Initial setup"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

That's it! The commands are ready to use.

After you connect a GitHub remote, use `/nn-push` in Cursor whenever you want to commit and push your latest notes and todos.

## Updating

To get the latest commands, run from your notes directory:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ma-cohen/notes-ninja/main/update.sh | bash
```

Your notes and todos are never touched - only the `.cursor` folder is updated.

If you installed an older version that auto-committed after changes, updating replaces that behavior with the manual `/nn-push` command.

## Commands

Type `/` in chat to see available commands:

### /nn-todo - Add Todo Items

```
/nn-todo buy groceries
```

```
/nn-todo call mom, finish report, book dentist
```

```
/nn-todo add book flights to travel
```

The assistant adds todos to an existing todo set in `todos/`. If you name an existing list, it adds there. If the target is unclear, it uses `todos/main.md`. It will not create new todo lists.

### /nn-new-todo - Create A Todo Set

```
/nn-new-todo personal website
```

```
/nn-new-todo kitchen renovation
```

The assistant creates a new empty todo-set file like `todos/personal-website.md`.

### /nn-split-todo - Split Work Into A Todo Set

```
/nn-split-todo move the app launch tasks into their own list
```

```
/nn-split-todo split kitchen renovation from main
```

The assistant finds matching open tasks, creates a new todo-set file in `todos/`, and asks you to confirm before moving any todos. Notes are not changed.

### /nn-remove-task - Remove Completed Todo Items

```
/nn-remove-task finished buy groceries
```

```
/nn-remove-task done with call mom and book dentist
```

The assistant will remove matching open tasks from your todo sets. You can name a specific todo set, or let it search all todo sets.

### /nn-prioritize - Organize Todo Priority

```
/nn-prioritize
```

```
/nn-prioritize figure out what should happen first
```

The assistant will reorder open todos in one todo set by inferred dependency chains. If you do not name a todo set, it uses `todos/main.md`.

### /nn-jira-start - Gather Jira Data For Todos

```
/nn-jira-start todos/work.md
```

```
/nn-jira-start work
```

The assistant reads one todo file, searches Jira through the configured Atlassian MCP server for related issues, and writes the findings under a `## Jira data` section in that todo file.

### /nn-jira - Work With Linked Jira Issues

```
/nn-jira show status for login flow
```

```
/nn-jira move login flow to In Progress
```

The assistant finds the todo, reads its Jira marker, and uses the Atlassian MCP server to complete the requested Jira action.

### /nn-add - Add Notes/Ideas

```
/nn-add learned that Python decorators are just syntactic sugar for higher-order functions
```

```
/nn-add idea: app that tracks water intake
```

The assistant will automatically find the best file to add your note to, or create a new one if needed.

### /nn-ask - Query Your Notes

```
/nn-ask what ideas do I have about apps?
```

```
/nn-ask what did I learn about Python?
```

```
/nn-ask what todos do I have?
```

### /nn-organize - Reorganize Notes

```
/nn-organize combine my Python notes into one file
```

```
/nn-organize split mixed app ideas into separate topic files
```

The assistant will reorganize files in `notes/` based on your request while preserving note content, dates, and frontmatter.

### /nn-just-do-it - Interactive Task Coach

```
/nn-just-do-it
```

The assistant will review your open todos, help you pick one mission to do now, and wait for you to report back. When you finish, it removes that mission from the todo set it came from.

### /nn-push - Commit and Push

```
/nn-push
```

The assistant will review your repository changes, create a meaningful commit, and push it to GitHub. You decide when to run it.

## How It Works

- **Todos** are stored as simple checkbox lists in `todos/*.md`
- **Todo sets** are separate markdown files in `todos/`, with `todos/main.md` as the default list
- **Jira data** is stored in a `## Jira data` section after `/nn-jira-start` gathers related issues through an Atlassian MCP server
- **Notes** are stored globally in `notes/` as markdown files, organized by topic and reorganized with `/nn-organize` when needed
- **Syncing** happens when you run `/nn-push`, so commits and pushes are always user-initiated

Jira commands require an Atlassian MCP server configured in Cursor before they can gather data or update issues.

## Tips

- Keep your notes atomic - one idea per `/nn-add` command
- Use `/nn-prioritize` when your todo list needs a practical order based on dependencies
- Use `/nn-new-todo` when you want to start a new empty todo set
- Use `/nn-split-todo` when existing todo work deserves its own list
- Use `/nn-jira-start` to gather related Jira context for a todo file
- Use `/nn-ask` to find things you've forgotten
- Use `/nn-organize` when related notes should be combined, split, renamed, or moved
- Run `/nn-push` when you want to save your latest changes to GitHub
- Your data is safe in GitHub - commit history preserves everything
